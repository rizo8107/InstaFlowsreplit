- Check tool results and handle errors gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Sending Messages

- âœ… Ensure recipient ID is valid
- âœ… Check account has necessary permissions

### Flow Not Executing
- âœ… Verify flow name exactly matches

- âœ… Check flow has correct trigger type
- âœ… Provide required test data

### Tools Not Working
- âœ… Ensure "Enable Tools" is checked
- âœ… Verify tools are selected in agent config

- âœ… Review error messages in chat

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Multiple Tools
Agents can chain tool calls for complex workflows:

1. **Get Contacts** â†’ Find user information
2. **Search Knowledge** â†’ Check previous interactions
3. **Send DM** â†’ Send personalized message
4. **Execute Flow** â†’ Trigger follow-up automation

### Scheduled Automation
Use `get_current_time` to implement time-based logic:
- Send good morning messages
- Follow up after specific time periods
- Schedule promotional messages

### Context-Aware Responses
Agents use memory to:
- Remember customer preferences
- Track conversation history
- Provide consistent support across sessions

## Integration with Existing Flows

AI Agents **complement** your existing Instagram automation flows:

- **Flows** handle structured, predictable sequences
- **Agents** handle dynamic, conversational responses
- **Together** they create intelligent, automated customer experiences

Example workflow:
1. Flow detects new DM (Trigger)
2. Flow checks for keywords (Condition)
3. If complex query â†’ Agent handles personalized response
4. If simple â†’ Flow sends pre-defined message
5. Agent can trigger additional flows as needed

# Webhook Security Fix - Summary

## ✅ Critical Security Issue Fixed

### 🔒 Missing Signature Validation

**Problem:** Instagram webhook POST endpoint was NOT validating the `X-Hub-Signature-256` header, allowing anyone to send forged webhook events.

**Impact:** 
- Attackers could send fake DM/comment events
- Trigger unauthorized flow executions
- Spam automation system
- Consume server resources

**Fixed:** ✅ Added HMAC SHA256 signature validation with proper security guards

---

## 🛡️ Security Improvements Applied

### 1. **Signature Validation** ✅
- Validates `X-Hub-Signature-256` header on all webhook requests
- Uses HMAC SHA256 with App Secret to verify authenticity
- Rejects invalid signatures with 403 Forbidden

### 2. **DoS Attack Prevention** ✅
- **Length check** before `timingSafeEqual()` prevents crashes
- Malformed signatures return clean 403 (no stack traces leaked)
- Invalid hex encoding handled gracefully

### 3. **Configuration Safety** ✅
- Explicit check for `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` environment variable
- Clear error logging if app secret is missing
- Fail-fast behavior prevents silent failures

### 4. **Timing Attack Protection** ✅
- Uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` for secure comparison
- Prevents timing-based signature analysis attacks

### 5. **Raw Body Capture** ✅
- Captures raw body before JSON parsing for accurate signature validation
- Applied only to `/api/webhooks` routes for efficiency

## 📝 What Was Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **server/routes.ts**
   - Added `validateWebhookSignature()` function with security guards
   - Updated POST `/api/webhooks/instagram` to validate signatures
   - Added crypto import for HMAC operations
   - Fixed health check endpoint

2. **server/index.ts**
   - Added raw body capture middleware for webhook routes
   - Ensures signature validation uses exact payload Instagram signed

3. **WEBHOOK_SECURITY_FIX.md** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive security documentation
   - Testing instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Verify App Secret is Set

```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET

# In Docker
docker-compose exec app env | grep INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET
```

### 2. Test with Meta App Dashboard

1. Go to Meta App Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Click **Test** button for Instagram webhook
3. Check logs - should see: `✅ Webhook signature validated`

### 3. Test Invalid Signature (Should Fail)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/instagram \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=invalid" \
  -d '{"object":"instagram","entry":[]}'

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
# Log: "❌ Signature validation failed"
```

### 4. Test Missing Signature (Should Fail)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/instagram \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"object":"instagram","entry":[]}'

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
# Log: "❌ No X-Hub-Signature-256 header found"
```

## 📊 Expected Log Output

### ✅ Valid Webhook (Success)
```
✅ Webhook signature validated
Webhook received: {"object":"instagram","entry":[...]}
Processing webhook for Instagram user ID: 123456789
```

### ❌ Invalid Signature
```
❌ Signature validation failed - length mismatch
   Received length: 10
   Expected length: 64
🚨 SECURITY: Invalid webhook signature - possible forged request!
```

### ❌ Missing Signature
```
❌ No X-Hub-Signature-256 header found
🚨 SECURITY: Invalid webhook signature - possible forged request!
```

### 🚨 Missing App Secret
```
🚨 CRITICAL: INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET is not set!
   All webhooks will be rejected until this is configured.
🚨 SECURITY: Invalid webhook signature - possible forged request!
```

## 🔐 Security Status

**Before:** ❌ Vulnerable to forged webhooks, DoS attacks, silent configuration failures
**After:** ✅ Production-ready secure implementation

**Compliance:**
- ✅ Follows Instagram/Meta webhook security standards
- ✅ DoS attack prevention (length check + error handling)
- ✅ Timing attack protection (crypto.timingSafeEqual)
- ✅ Configuration validation (fail-fast on missing secret)
- ✅ Proper error handling (no stack trace leaks)

**Architect Review:** ✅ APPROVED
- No security issues found
- DoS vector fixed
- Configuration safety added
- Defensive coding practices followed

## 📚 Documentation

- **WEBHOOK_SECURITY_FIX.md** - Detailed technical documentation
- **INSTAGRAM_AUTH_WEBHOOK_GUIDE.md** - Webhook setup guide
- **README.md** - Updated with requirements
- **This file** - Quick reference summary

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET must be set** - Without it, ALL webhooks will be rejected
2. **Raw body is required** - Signature validation needs exact payload Instagram signed
3. **Middleware order matters** - Webhook body capture runs before global JSON parsing
4. **403 is normal** - Invalid signatures should return 403, not 500
5. **No breaking changes** - Existing webhooks continue working if properly signed

---

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

The webhook security fix is **production-ready** and has been architect-approved with no security issues found.

**What's Secure Now:**
- ✅ Forged webhook prevention
- ✅ DoS attack prevention  
- ✅ Configuration validation
- ✅ Timing attack protection
- ✅ Proper error handling

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Ensure `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` is set in production
3. Test webhooks via Meta App Dashboard
4. Monitor logs for signature validation

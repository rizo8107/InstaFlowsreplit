Setup Webhooks Subscriptions
This document shows you how to create an endpoint on your server to receive webhook notifications from Meta and subscribe to webhook fields for an Instagram professional account using your app. This allows you to receive real-time notifications whenever someone comments on the Media objects of the Instagram professional account using your app, @mentions your app users, when your app users' Stories expire, or when a Instagram user sends a message to that Instagram professional account.

The steps
The steps required to receive webhook notifications are as follows:

Step 1. Create an endpoint on your server to receive webhooks from Meta
Verify requests from Meta – Occurs in the Meta App Dashboard
Accept and validate JSON payloads from Meta – Occurs on your server
Step 2. Subscribe your app to webhook fields – Occurs in the Meta App Dashboard
Step 3. Enable your app user's Instagram professional account to receive notifications via an API call to Meta
Step 4. Test the setup by sending a message to your Instagram professional account.
Sample app on Github
We provide a sample app on GitHub that deploys on Heroku which you can set up and repurpose, or which you can use to quickly test your Webhooks configuration.

You need the following:

A free Heroku account,
Your app's App Secret found on Meta App Dashboard App settings > Basic
A Verify token which is a string. In your Heroku app's settings, set up two config vars: APP_SECRET and TOKEN. Set APP_SECRET to your app's App Secret and TOKEN to your password. We will include this string in any verification requests when you configure the Webhooks product in the App Dashboard (the app will validate the request on its own).

View your Heroku app in a web browser. You should see an empty array ([]). This page will display newly received update notification data, so reload it throughout testing.

Your app's Callback URL will be your Heroku app's URL with /facebook added to the end. You will need this Callback URL during product configuration.
Copy the TOKEN value you set above; you'll also need this during product configuration.
What's in the Heroku sample app?
The app uses Node.js and these packages:

body-parser (for parsing JSON)
express (for routes)
express-x-hub (for SHA1 support)
Verifying the Sample App
You can easily verify that your sample app can receive Webhook events.

Under the Webhooks product in your App Dashboard, click the Test button for any of the Webhook fields.
A pop-up dialog will appear showing a sample of what will be sent. Click Send to My Server.
You should now see the Webhook information at the Heroku app's URL, or use curl https://<your-subdomain>.herokuapp.com in a terminal window.

Limitations
Apps must be set to Live in the App Dashboard to receive webhook notifications.
Advanced Access is required to receive comments and live_comments webhook notifications.
The Instagram professional account that owns the media objects must be public to receive notifications for comments or @mentions.
Notifications for Comments on Live media are only sent during the live broadcast.
Account level webhooks customization is not supported. If your app user is subscribed to any Instagram webhook field, your app receives notifications for all fields the app is subscribed to.
Album IDs are not included in webhook notifications. Use the Comment ID received in the notification to get the album ID.
The ad ID will not be returned for media used in dynamic ads.
Notifications for story_insights events will only show metrics for the first 24 hours, before the story expires, even if the story is a highlight.
Create an endpoint
This step must be completed before you can subscribe to any webhook fields in the App Dashboard.

Your endpoint must be able to process two types of HTTPS requests: Verification Requests and Event Notifications. Since both requests use HTTPs, your server must have a valid TLS or SSL certificate correctly configured and installed. Self-signed certificates are not supported.

The sections below explain what will be in each type of request and how to respond to them. Alternatively, you can use our sample app which is already configured to process these requests.

Verification Requests
Anytime you configure the Webhooks product in your App Dashboard, we'll send a GET request to your endpoint URL. Verification requests include the following query string parameters, appended to the end of your endpoint URL. They will look something like this:

Sample Verification Request
GET https://www.your-clever-domain-name.com/webhooks?
  hub.mode=subscribe&
  hub.challenge=1158201444&
  hub.verify_token=meatyhamhock
Parameter	Sample Value	Description
hub.mode

subscribe

This value will always be set to subscribe.

hub.challenge

1158201444

An int you must pass back to us.

hub.verify_token

meatyhamhock

A string that that we grab from the Verify Token field in your app's App Dashboard. You will set this string when you complete the Webhooks configuration settings steps.

Note: PHP converts periods (.) to underscores (_) in parameter names.

Validating Verification Requests
Whenever your endpoint receives a verification request, it must:

Verify that the hub.verify_token value matches the string you set in the Verify Token field when you configure the Webhooks product in your App Dashboard (you haven't set up this token string yet).
Respond with the hub.challenge value.
If you are in your App Dashboard and configuring your Webhooks product (and thus, triggering a Verification Request), the dashboard will indicate if your endpoint validated the request correctly. If you are using the Graph API's /app/subscriptions endpoint to configure the Webhooks product, the API will indicate success or failure with a response.

Event Notifications
When you configure your Webhooks product, you will subscribe to specific fields on an object type (e.g., the photos field on the user object). Whenever there's a change to one of these fields, we will send your endpoint a POST request with a JSON payload describing the change.

For example, if you subscribed to the user object's photos field and one of your app's Users posted a Photo, we would send you a POST request that would look something like this:

POST / HTTPS/1.1
Host: your-clever-domain-name.com/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256={super-long-SHA256-signature}
Content-Length: 311

{
  "entry": [
    {
      "time": 1520383571,
      "changes": [
        {
          "field": "photos",
          "value":
            {
              "verb": "update",
              "object_id": "10211885744794461"
            }
        }
      ],
      "id": "10210299214172187",
      "uid": "10210299214172187"
    }
  ],
  "object": "user"
}
Payload Contents
Payloads will contain an object describing the change. When you configure the webhooks product, you can indicate if payloads should only contain the names of changed fields, or if payloads should include the new values as well.

We format all payloads with JSON, so you can parse the payload using common JSON parsing methods or packages.

You will not be able to query historical webhook event notification data, so be sure to capture and store any webhook payload content that you want to keep.

Most payloads will contain the following common properties, but the contents and structure of each payload varies depending on the object fields you are subscribed to. Refer to each object's reference document to see which fields will be included.

Property	Description	Type
object

The object's type (e.g., user, page, etc.)

string

entry

An array containing an object describing the changes. Multiple changes from different objects that are of the same type may be batched together.

array

id

The object's ID

string

changed_fields

An array of strings indicating the names of the fields that have been changed. Only included if you disable the Include Values setting when configuring the Webhooks product in your app's App Dashboard.

array

changes

An array containing an object describing the changed fields and their new values. Only included if you enable the Include Values setting when configuring the Webhooks product in your app's App Dashboard.

array

time

A UNIX timestamp indicating when the Event Notification was sent (not when the change that triggered the notification occurred).

int

Validating Payloads
We sign all Event Notification payloads with a SHA256 signature and include the signature in the request's X-Hub-Signature-256 header, preceded with sha256=. You don't have to validate the payload, but you should.

To validate the payload:

Generate a SHA256 signature using the payload and your app's App Secret.
Compare your signature to the signature in the X-Hub-Signature-256 header (everything after sha256=). If the signatures match, the payload is genuine.
Responding to Event Notifications
Your endpoint should respond to all Event Notifications with 200 OK HTTPS.

Frequency
Event Notifications are aggregated and sent in a batch with a maximum of 1000 updates. However batching cannot be guaranteed so be sure to adjust your servers to handle each Webhook individually.

If any update sent to your server fails, we will retry immediately, then try a few more times with decreasing frequency over the next 36 hours. Your server should handle deduplication in these cases. Unacknowledged responses will be dropped after 36 hours.

Note: The frequency with which Messenger event notifications are sent is different. Please refer to the Messenger Platform Webhooks documentation for more information.

Enable Subscriptions
Your app must enable subscriptions by sending a POST request to the /me/subscribed_apps endpoint with the subscribed_fields parameter set to a comma-separated list of webhooks fields.

Request Syntax
Formatted for readability.

POST /me/subscribed_apps
  ?subscribed_fields=<LIST_OF_WEBHOOK_FIELDS>
  &<ACCESS_TOKEN>
Request Parameters
Value Placeholder	Value Description
/me

Represents your app user's Instagram professional account ID or the Facebook Page ID that is linked to your app user's Instagram professional account

<ACCESS_TOKEN>

  &access_token=EAAFB..."
On success, your app receives a JSON response with success set to true.

{
  "success": true
}

mTLS for Webhooks
Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a method for mutual authentication.

mTLS ensures that the parties at each end of a network connection are who they claim to be by verifying that they both have the correct private key. The information within their respective TLS certificates provides additional verification.

How to configure mTLS
Once you enable mTLS on your subscription to WhatsApp Business Account, Meta will present a client certificate together with its signing intermediate certificate. Both certificates are used to create a TLS handshake of Webhook requests to your server. Your server then can verify the sender’s identity of these requests by the trust chain and the common name (CN).

The client certificate is signed by an intermediate CA certificate, DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA, and then by a root CA certificate, DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA. Note that the intermediate certificate also signs the certificate for graph.facebook.com:

Client Certificate Verification
After setting up HTTPS for receiving Webhook requests, complete the following steps to verify the client certificate and its common name client.webhooks.fbclientcerts.com:

Install the root certificate
Verify the client certificate against the root certificate
Verify the common name (client.webhooks.fbclientcerts.com) of the client certificate
Note: Servers receiving Webhooks must be using HTTPS; and we are always verifying the certificate from your HTTPS server for security.

Example
Depending on your server’s setup, the above steps vary in details. We illustrate by two examples, one for Nginx and one for AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Nginx
Download the root certificate (DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA) from DigiCert to your server, e.g. /etc/ssl/certs/DigiCert_High_Assurance_EV_Root_CA.pem

Turn on mTLS by Nginx directives (example screenshot)

ssl_verify_client       on;
ssl_client_certificate  /etc/ssl/certs/DigiCert_High_Assurance_EV_Root_CA.pem;
ssl_verify_depth        3;
Verify the CN from Nginx embedded variable $ssl_client_s_dn equals "client.webhooks.fbclientcerts.com" (example screenshot)

if ($ssl_client_s_dn ~ "CN=client.webhooks.fbclientcerts.com") {
    return 200 "$ssl_client_s_dn";
}
AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Download the intermediate certificate (DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA) from DigiCert to a S3 bucket. The root certificate is not accepted by AWS because it is signed using algorithm SHA1withRSA; while the intermediate certificate is signed using SHA256withRSA thereby accepted.
Configure the HTTPS listener on the ALB to enable mTLS with the trust store containing the certificate in the S3 bucket (example screenshot).
In your application code, extract the CN from the HTTP header “X-Amzn-Mtls-Clientcert-Subject”, and verify it equals “client.webhooks.fbclientcerts.com”.
Test setup
Send your Instagram professional account a test message (the public account added in the Meta App Dashboard for testing). This should trigger a messages webhook event. The notification should contain the recipient.id, set to your Instagram professional account's Instagram-scoped ID, and the is_echo and is_self properties, both set to true, within the messaging array.
Send a response to your Instagram-scoped ID using the API.

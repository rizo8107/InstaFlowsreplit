# Instagram Automation Platform

## Overview
A comprehensive web-based Instagram automation platform that enables users to create sophisticated chat flow workflows for managing multiple Instagram accounts through a visual drag-and-drop interface builder.

## Purpose
The platform connects multiple Instagram accounts via Graph API tokens and provides a visual flow builder with:
- Condition nodes (if/else logic with AND/OR operators)
- Action nodes (reply, message, delete, hide, like, send links, API calls, delays)
- Variable support for dynamic messaging
- Real-time webhook processing
- Comprehensive activity logging

## Current State
The MVP is complete with:
- Full-stack TypeScript application with Express backend and React frontend
- Visual drag-and-drop flow builder using ReactFlow
- Multi-account Instagram management
- Flow execution engine with condition evaluation
- Instagram Graph API integration
- Webhook handler for real-time events
- Activity logging dashboard

## Recent Changes
- **Instagram Private Reply Implementation (October 12, 2025)**: Implemented proper Private Reply API for comment-triggered DM actions
  - **Messenger Platform Integration**: Added Facebook Page ID and Page Access Token support to account schema
  - **Private Reply API**: Implemented `sendPrivateReply` using `graph.facebook.com/v24.0/{PAGE_ID}/messages` with `messaging_type: "RESPONSE"`
  - **Smart Routing**: Flow engine automatically detects comment triggers and uses Private Reply (text-only) vs regular DMs (with button template support)
  - **Condition Edge Routing Fixed**: Fixed flow engine to check `sourceHandle` instead of `edge.id` for proper condition branching (true/false paths)

- **Comment Flow Actions Fixed (October 12, 2025)**: Fixed variable extraction for comment events to enable DM actions
  - **sender_id Mapping**: Added sender_id mapping from from_id for comment events to enable send_dm actions
  - **Variable Extraction**: Comment events now properly set sender_id variable for DM/Private Reply functionality
  - **Comment Moderation API**: Reply to comment uses correct endpoint `/<IG_COMMENT_ID>/replies` with `message` parameter

- **UI Improvements & Button Templates (October 12, 2025)**: Enhanced condition configuration and added Instagram DM button template support
  - **Condition Field Dropdown**: Converted condition field input to dropdown with predefined options (message_text, comment_text, username, user_id, sender_id, comment_id, message_id, media_id)
  - **Improved Operator Labels**: Updated "not_contains" to "Does Not Contain" and "not_equals" to "Does Not Equal" for clarity
  - **Button Template Support**: Added full Instagram Generic Template support for DM actions
    - Up to 3 buttons per message with web_url (opens URL) or postback (webhook callback) types
    - Optional subtitle field for richer message templates
    - Buttons configured per flow node with title, URL, and payload options
    - Flow engine automatically detects button config and routes to appropriate API method
  - **Template Flow Creation Fixed**: Backend now properly creates flows from templates instead of just returning template data

- **Complete Instagram Graph API v24.0 Compliance (October 12, 2025)**: Fixed all action nodes to match Instagram Graph API v24.0
  - **Updated API Base URL**: Changed from `graph.instagram.com` to `graph.instagram.com/v24.0`
  - **DM Actions Fixed**: 
    - Updated endpoint to `/{instagram_user_id}/messages` (correct v24.0 format)
    - Request format: `{recipient: {id: sender_id}, message: {text: "..."}}`
    - Uses `sender_id` directly from webhook (no conversation_id needed)
    - Both `send_dm` and `send_link` now use sender_id with recipient.id format
  - **All Comment Actions Enhanced**:
    - Reply to Comment: Proper error handling and result tracking
    - Delete Comment: Full error details and logging
    - Hide Comment: Complete error handling
    - Like Comment: Detailed result tracking

- `INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` - Facebook App ID with Instagram permissions
- `INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET` - Facebook App Secret
- `INSTAGRAM_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` - Custom webhook verification token
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key

## Key Features
1. **Visual Flow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating automation workflows
2. **Multi-Account Support**: Manage multiple Instagram accounts from one dashboard
3. **Condition Logic**: Complex if/else conditions with AND/OR operators
4. **Action Types**: Reply, DM, delete, hide, like, send links, API calls, delays

## User Workflow
1. **Deploy the application** - Click Publish to make webhook accessible
2. **Configure webhook** - Copy webhook URL from Accounts page, add to Meta for Developers
3. **Connect Instagram account** - Add account with Graph API token
4. **Create automation flow** - Use templates or build custom flow with trigger type
5. **Add logic nodes** - Add condition nodes to filter events, action nodes to respond
6. **Activate flow** - Toggle flow to active to start automation
7. **Monitor executions** - View real-time execution logs in Activity page

### Webhook Flow:
1. Instagram sends event (comment, DM, mention) â†’ `/api/webhooks/instagram`
2. System finds active flows matching event type and account
3. Flow engine executes flow with condition evaluation
4. Actions performed via Instagram Graph API
5. Execution logged with success/failure status

## Technical Notes
- Uses PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for persistence
- Instagram API calls require valid access tokens with `instagram_business_manage_messages` and `instagram_business_manage_comments` scopes
- **DM Actions**: 
  - **From Comments (Private Reply)**: Uses Messenger Platform API `POST /v24.0/{PAGE_ID}/messages` with `{recipient: {comment_id: "..."}, message: {text: "..."}, messaging_type: "RESPONSE"}`. Requires Facebook Page ID and Page Access Token configured in account settings. Text-only (button templates not supported).
  - **From DMs (Direct Message)**: Uses Instagram API `POST /{instagram_user_id}/messages` with `{recipient: {id: sender_id}, message: {text: "..."}}`. Supports button templates.
- Webhooks need to be configured in Meta for Developers console
- Flow execution is asynchronous with error handling
- All dates stored as JavaScript Date objects  
- Node types: trigger, condition, action with type-specific data
- Templates are auto-seeded on first server start

## Known Issues
- Template-to-flow conversion dialog requires manual account selection testing (automated test agent encounters form validation issues, but manual testing works correctly)

## Future Enhancements
- Flow testing mode (dry run)
- Analytics dashboard
- Flow versioning
- Advanced scheduling
- Multi-language support
- Team collaboration features

# AI Agent Flow Integration - Complete Implementation

## Overview
AI agents have been successfully integrated as ACTION NODES within automation flows. When a flow executes and reaches an AI agent action node, it automatically starts an AI-powered conversation with the Instagram user.

## Architecture

### Flow Execution
1. **Trigger Event**: Flow is triggered by Instagram webhook (DM, comment, story mention, etc.)
2. **AI Agent Action**: When flow reaches an `ai_agent` action node:
   - Creates `activeAgentConversation` record
   - Sends initial context to agent (trigger type, username, message content)
   - Agent analyzes context and sends opening DM
   - Conversation becomes active

### Conversation Lifecycle
1. **Initialization** (Flow Engine):
   - Flow engine creates active conversation
   - Persists initial context message to `messages` table
   - Agent generates response using Gemini chatWithTools
   - Persists agent response to `messages` table
   - Sends agent response as Instagram DM

2. **Ongoing Conversation** (Webhook Handler):
   - User replies to agent's DM
   - Webhook receives incoming message
   - Checks for active agent conversation for this user
   - If active, routes message to agent (NOT to flow execution)
   - Agent generates response with full conversation history
   - Persists both user message and agent response
   - Sends agent response as DM

3. **Deactivation**:
   - Agent or user can end conversation
   - Update `isActive: false` on conversation
   - Future messages from user will trigger flows normally

## Database Schema

### Active Agent Conversations
```typescript
activeAgentConversations table:
- id: unique identifier
- agentId: reference to AI agent
- contactId: Instagram user being conversed with
- senderId: Instagram PSID
- accountId: Instagram account handling the conversation
- flowExecutionId: optional reference to triggering flow execution
- isActive: boolean - whether conversation is currently active
- createdAt: timestamp
```

### Message Persistence
- Initial flow context saved as "user" role message
- Agent responses saved as "assistant" role messages
- Subsequent user messages and agent replies also persisted
- Full conversation history maintained for context

## Implementation Files

### Backend
- **server/flow-engine.ts**: Handles `ai_agent` action execution
  - Creates active conversation
  - Persists initial messages
  - Sends agent response
  
- **server/routes.ts**: Webhook message routing
  - Checks for active agent conversations
  - Routes to agent instead of flow when active
  - Persists all messages for history

- **server/storage.ts**: Storage interface
  - createActiveAgentConversation()
  - deactivateAgentConversation()
  - getActiveConversationForContact()
  - Full message CRUD operations

### Frontend
- **client/src/components/flow-builder/node-config-panel.tsx**:
  - AI Agent action type configuration
  - Agent selection dropdown
  - React hooks properly ordered (useQuery before early returns)
  
- **client/src/components/flow-builder/custom-nodes.tsx**:
  - AI Agent action node rendering
  - Visual indication of selected agent

## Key Features

### 1. Context-Aware Initialization
- Agent receives rich context: trigger type, username, message text
- First response is contextual and relevant
- Example: "New message from Instagram user @john: 'Hello'"

### 2. Conversation Memory
- Full message history persisted
- Agent maintains context across turns
- Can reference earlier conversation points

### 3. Tool Integration
- Agent can use tools (send_instagram_dm, trigger_flow, etc.)
- Can search knowledge bases if configured
- Can execute other automation flows

### 4. Non-Blocking Flow Execution
- Active conversations prevent duplicate flow triggers
- One conversation per contact at a time
- Clean separation of automated responses vs flow execution

## Testing Checklist

✅ Flow Builder UI:
- No React hooks errors
- Agent selection dropdown works
- Can create and save flows with AI agent actions

✅ Flow Execution:
- AI agent action creates active conversation
- Initial context message persisted
- Agent response generated and sent
- Agent response persisted to history

✅ Webhook Handling:
- Active conversations detected
- Messages routed to agent (not flow)
- User and agent messages both persisted
- Full conversation history maintained

✅ Conversation Management:
- Deactivation works correctly
- One active conversation per contact
- Messages after deactivation trigger flows normally

## Usage Example

### Creating a Customer Support Flow
1. Create trigger: "When user sends DM"
2. Add condition: "If message contains 'help' or 'support'"
3. Add AI Agent action:
   - Select "Customer Support Agent"
   - Agent will analyze request and provide help
   - Conversation continues until resolved

### Creating a Lead Qualification Flow
1. Create trigger: "When user comments on post"
2. Add condition: "If comment contains interest keywords"
3. Add AI Agent action:
   - Select "Lead Qualification Agent"
   - Agent asks qualifying questions
   - Can trigger "Add to CRM" flow based on responses

## Benefits

1. **Natural Conversations**: AI handles back-and-forth naturally
2. **Context Preservation**: Full history maintained
3. **Tool Capabilities**: Agent can execute actions and flows
4. **Flexible Integration**: Works with any trigger type
5. **Scalable**: Handles multiple concurrent conversations
6. **Intelligent**: Gemini-powered with RAG capabilities

## Future Enhancements

- Conversation analytics and insights
- Multi-agent handoff capabilities
- Sentiment analysis and escalation
- Conversation templates and scripts
- A/B testing different agent personas

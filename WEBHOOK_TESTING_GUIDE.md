   - Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/4224943747791118/webhooks/
   - Should see green checkmark

2. ‚úÖ Is INSTAGRAM_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN set?
   - Check Replit Secrets
   - Must match token in Meta Dashboard

   - Should show account username

4. ‚úÖ Is app running?
   - Check workflow status
